Based on the provided table, it seems that the table is about the moisture content of various nano-composite samples under different conditions. However, the table does not provide all the necessary information to fill out the JSON template. The table does not provide information about the sample ID number, matrix name, filler name, filler description, composition, or particle surface treatment name. 

The table does provide information about the properties of the samples, specifically their moisture content under different conditions. However, without the other necessary information, it is not possible to generate a complete JSON output for each nano-composite sample. 

Here is an example of how the JSON might look with the available information:

{
    "sample_id": null,
    "matrix_name": null,
    "filler_name": null,
    "filler description": null,
    "composition": {
        "amount": null,
        "type": null
    },
    "particle_surface_treatment_name": null,
    "properties": {
        "moisture content": {
            "value": 0.01,
            "unit": "wt%",
            "conditions": [
                {"type": "temperature", "value": 25, "unit": "Â°C"},
                {"type": "relative humidity", "value": 100, "unit": "%"}
            ]
        }
    }
}

Please provide the missing information so that a complete JSON output can be generated for each nano-composite sample.
